% rewriteDefault
% Example file on how to override a mVisionConfig
% This one only overrides default values with other default values
%
% You can put any number of lines such as
% FIELD_NAME = value
% where FIELD_NAME is a valid property identifier of class mVisionConfig
% This type of script will be parsed during the execution of mVisionConfig
% constructor, just by executing 'obj.FIELD_NAME = value'.
%
% Don't forget to reference your custom configuration in the static file
% STATIC_CONFIG_LIST
% Comments and empty lines allowed.
